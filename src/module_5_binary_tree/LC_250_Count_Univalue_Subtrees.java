    //  - This is confusing but think about it as an opportunity to practice asking questions to interviewers
    //    This is your cue to create some quick sample test cases and check your understanding.
    //
    //    This is what you would need to do in an interview setting as well as well by asking the interviewer clarifying questions.
    //    If the question isn't presented 100% clearly you're responsible for asking questions until you're clear,
    //    and whether the ambiguity is on purpose or just lazy question writing won't matter in that setting.

    //  - We can stand at one node and look down to see all its children.
    //    If this node's value == all it's child nodes' value,
    //    then the subtree with this node as root is a uni-value subtree
